# GTM LinkedIn

Write LinkedIn messages that get accepted and start conversations.

## Connection Requests

**Limit: 300 characters** - Make every word count.

### Formula
```
{Personalization hook} + {Reason for connecting} + {Soft CTA}
```

### Templates

**Mutual Connection:**
```
Hi {name}, saw we're both connected to {mutual}.
Always looking to connect with {role}s in {industry}.
Would love to be in your network.
```

**Shared Event:**
```
Hi {name}, enjoyed your session at {event}.
Your point about {topic} resonated.
Would love to connect and continue the conversation.
```

**Content Engagement:**
```
Hi {name}, your post about {topic} was spot on.
Especially the point about {specific_insight}.
Would love to connect.
```

**Same Industry:**
```
Hi {name}, noticed you're leading {function} at {company}.
I work with similar teams on {value_prop}.
Always great to connect with folks in the space.
```

**Role Change:**
```
Hi {name}, congrats on the new role at {company}!
{Company} is doing great things in {space}.
Would love to connect.
```

### What Works

✅ Under 300 characters
✅ Reference something specific
✅ Give a reason to connect
✅ No pitch in the request
✅ Professional but human tone

### What Fails

❌ "I'd like to add you to my network"
❌ Immediate pitch
❌ Generic "let's connect"
❌ Mentioning your product
❌ Asking for a meeting

## InMail Templates

### First Touch InMail
```
Hi {first_name},

{Personalization - 1 sentence max}

I work with {role}s at companies like {similar_company} who are dealing with {pain_point}.

Would you be open to a quick conversation about how we've helped them {result}?

{signature}
```

### Follow-Up InMail
```
Hi {first_name},

Following up on my previous message.

I came across {relevant_insight} and thought of {company}.

Would a 15-minute call be useful to explore if there's a fit?

{signature}
```

## Engagement Strategy

Before connecting, engage with their content:

### Comment Templates

**Agree + Add:**
```
Great point about {topic}. We've seen the same thing at {company/clients} -
especially around {related_insight}. Thanks for sharing.
```

**Question:**
```
Interesting perspective on {topic}. Curious - have you found that
{related_question}?
```

**Share Experience:**
```
This resonates. When we {similar_situation}, we found that {insight}.
Appreciate you sharing this.
```

### Engagement Sequence

1. **Day 1:** Like 2-3 of their posts
2. **Day 3:** Leave thoughtful comment
3. **Day 5:** Send connection request referencing the post
4. **Day 7:** (If accepted) Send thank you, no pitch
5. **Day 14:** Share something valuable, soft CTA

## Voice Notes

LinkedIn voice messages get 3x response rate:

```
"Hey {name}, quick voice note - saw your post about {topic} and it
really resonated. I work with {role}s on {value_prop} and thought
there might be some overlap. Would love to connect if you're open to it."
```

Keep under 60 seconds.

## Group Outreach

When connecting with group members:

```
Hi {name}, we're both in {group_name}. Your comment about {topic}
caught my attention. Would love to connect with fellow {role}s
in the group.
```

## Response Templates

### When They Accept
```
Thanks for connecting, {name}!

No pitch here - just wanted to say I've been following {company}'s
work in {space}. Impressive stuff.

If you ever want to swap notes on {topic}, happy to chat.
```

### When They Reply Positively
```
Great to hear, {name}.

Would {day} at {time} work for a quick call? I'll send a calendar invite.

Looking forward to it.
```

### When They're Busy
```
Totally understand, {name}.

I'll follow up in {timeframe}. In the meantime, here's a {resource}
you might find useful.

Talk soon.
