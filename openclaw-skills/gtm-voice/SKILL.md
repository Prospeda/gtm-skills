# GTM Voice

Scripts and talk tracks for cold calls, voicemails, and phone prospecting.

## Cold Call Openers

### The Pattern Interrupt
```
"Hi [Name], this is [Your name] from [Company].
I know I'm calling out of the blue - do you have 30 seconds
for me to tell you why I'm calling, and you can decide if
it's worth continuing?"
```

### The Referral Opener
```
"Hi [Name], [Mutual connection] suggested I give you a call.
They mentioned you might be dealing with [pain point].
Is that something you're focused on right now?"
```

### The Trigger Opener
```
"Hi [Name], I saw [Company] just [trigger event].
Congrats on that. I'm calling because we help companies
in similar situations with [value prop].
Is that on your radar at all?"
```

### The Permission Opener
```
"Hi [Name], this is [Your name]. I'm not sure if we're a fit,
but we help [persona] with [pain point]. Is that something
you're dealing with, or am I way off base?"
```

### The Honest Opener
```
"Hi [Name], I'll be honest - this is a cold call.
But I've done my homework. I saw [research insight] and
thought there might be a reason to talk. Am I catching
you at an okay time?"
```

## Voicemail Scripts

**Rule: Under 30 seconds. Leave a reason to call back.**

### Template 1: The Teaser
```
"Hi [Name], it's [Your name] from [Company].
I'm calling about [pain point] - specifically how
[similar company] solved it.
Give me a call at [number] if you'd like to hear more."
```
*~15 seconds*

### Template 2: The Question
```
"Hi [Name], [Your name] from [Company].
Quick question: are you still dealing with [pain point]?
If so, I have an idea that might help.
[Number] - talk soon."
```
*~12 seconds*

### Template 3: The Referral
```
"Hi [Name], [Mutual] suggested I reach out.
They mentioned you're focused on [priority].
We helped them with [result] - thought it might be relevant.
Call me at [number]."
```
*~15 seconds*

### Template 4: The Follow-Up
```
"Hi [Name], following up on my email from [day].
Wanted to see if [topic] is still a priority.
If so, [number]. If not, no worries at all."
```
*~10 seconds*

## Gatekeeper Scripts

### The Confident Ask
```
Gatekeeper: "[Company], how can I help you?"

You: "Hi, this is [Name] calling for [Prospect].
Is [he/she] available?"

Gatekeeper: "What is this regarding?"

You: "I'm following up on some information I sent over
about [topic]. [He/She]'ll know what it's about."
```

### The Referral Play
```
Gatekeeper: "What is this regarding?"

You: "I was speaking with [other contact/mutual] and
they suggested I reach out to [Prospect] about [topic].
Is [he/she] in today?"
```

### The Specific Ask
```
Gatekeeper: "What is this regarding?"

You: "It's about [specific topic relevant to their role].
Is now a good time, or should I try back at [specific time]?"
```

### When Blocked
```
Gatekeeper: "They're not available."

You: "I understand. When would be the best time to reach them?
I want to make sure I'm not interrupting their day."

OR

"Got it. Would you mind letting them know [Your name]
called about [topic]? They can reach me at [number]."
```

## Objection Responses (Phone-Specific)

### "I'm busy"
```
"I totally get it - I'll be brief.
Can I have 30 seconds to tell you why I called,
and you can decide if it's worth scheduling time?"
```

### "Just send me an email"
```
"Happy to. But to make sure I send the right info -
what would be most useful to see?
Is it more about [topic A] or [topic B]?"
```

### "We're all set"
```
"Good to hear. Out of curiosity, what are you using today?
Just want to make sure I'm not wasting your time if
there's no fit."
```

### "How did you get my number?"
```
"Fair question. Your info is public on [LinkedIn/website].
I reached out because [specific reason relevant to them].
Does that resonate at all, or am I off base?"
```

### "I don't take cold calls"
```
"I respect that. Would you prefer I reach out another way?
Email? LinkedIn? Or is this just not a priority right now?"
```
