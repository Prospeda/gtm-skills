# GTM Objections

Handle any sales objection like a pro. Never get caught off guard.

## The Framework: ACR

**Acknowledge → Clarify → Reframe**

1. **Acknowledge:** Validate their concern (shows you're listening)
2. **Clarify:** Ask questions to understand the real objection
3. **Reframe:** Present a new perspective or path forward

## Budget Objections

### "We don't have budget"

**Acknowledge:**
"I completely understand - budget is always a consideration."

**Clarify:**
"Help me understand - is it that there's no budget allocated for this type of initiative, or that the budget is committed elsewhere right now?"

**Reframe (if no budget exists):**
"Got it. Out of curiosity, if budget weren't a factor, would this be a priority? [If yes] Would it help if I showed you how [similar company] made the business case internally?"

**Reframe (if budget is committed):**
"Makes sense. When does your next planning cycle start? I want to make sure we're in the conversation at the right time."

---

### "It's too expensive"

**Acknowledge:**
"I hear you - it's a significant investment."

**Clarify:**
"When you say too expensive, are you comparing to alternatives, or is it the absolute number that's the concern?"

**Reframe:**
"Here's how I'd think about it: [Company] was paying $X in [hidden cost] before us. The ROI paid back the investment in [timeframe]. Would it help to walk through that math for your situation?"

---

### "We need to cut costs right now"

**Acknowledge:**
"Totally get it - a lot of companies are in the same boat."

**Clarify:**
"What's driving the cost pressure - is it a company-wide mandate or specific to your department?"

**Reframe:**
"Interesting. A few of our customers actually brought us in *because* of cost pressure - we helped [company] reduce [cost area] by [X%]. Would that be relevant here?"

---

## Timing Objections

### "Now isn't a good time"

**Acknowledge:**
"I appreciate you being upfront about that."

**Clarify:**
"What would make it a better time? Is it a bandwidth issue, or is there something else going on?"

**Reframe:**
"Makes sense. Here's what I'd suggest - let's put 15 minutes on the calendar for [future date]. That gives you time to [handle current priority], and we can see if the timing makes more sense then. How does [date] look?"

---

### "We're in the middle of another project"

**Acknowledge:**
"Totally understand - focus is important."

**Clarify:**
"What's the project, if you don't mind me asking? Just want to make sure we're not stepping on each other."

**Reframe:**
"Got it. Would it make sense to loop back once that's wrapped up? Or, some customers actually find our solution helps accelerate [related area] - worth a quick look?"

---

### "Check back next quarter"

**Acknowledge:**
"Sure, I can do that."

**Clarify:**
"Just so I come back with something useful - what's happening next quarter that makes it a better time?"

**Reframe:**
"Got it. I'll put a reminder in for [date]. In the meantime, I'll send over [relevant resource] in case it's helpful. Sound good?"

---

## Competition Objections

### "We're already using [Competitor]"

**Acknowledge:**
"Great - [Competitor] is solid."

**Clarify:**
"What made you choose them? And how's it going so far?"

**Reframe:**
"Makes sense. The reason I reached out is that companies like [similar customer] came to us specifically because [key differentiator]. Would it be worth a quick look to see if that's relevant?"

---

### "We're happy with what we have"

**Acknowledge:**
"That's great to hear - sounds like you made a good choice."

**Clarify:**
"Out of curiosity, what's working really well? And if you could wave a magic wand, what would you improve?"

**Reframe:**
"Interesting. That [improvement area] is actually where we see the biggest impact. Worth a 15-minute look?"

---

### "We're evaluating other options"

**Acknowledge:**
"Makes sense to see what's out there."

**Clarify:**
"Who else are you looking at? And what's most important in your decision?"

**Reframe:**
"Got it. Here's what I'd suggest - let's do a quick comparison call so you can see how we stack up on [their criteria]. That way you can make an informed decision. Fair?"

---

## Authority Objections

### "I need to talk to my team/boss"

**Acknowledge:**
"Of course - you want to make sure everyone's aligned."

**Clarify:**
"Who else needs to be involved? And what do you think their main concerns will be?"

**Reframe:**
"Would it help if I put together a one-pager you can share? Or, even better - would it make sense to set up a quick call with them included?"

---

### "Send me some information"

**Acknowledge:**
"Happy to."

**Clarify:**
"What specifically would be most useful? I want to send you the right stuff, not just a generic deck."

**Reframe:**
"Here's what I'd suggest - let me send a [specific resource]. But honestly, a 15-minute call would be more useful than a PDF. Can we find time this week?"

---

### "I'm not the right person"

**Acknowledge:**
"Thanks for letting me know."

**Clarify:**
"Who would be the right person to talk to about this? And would you be comfortable making an intro, or should I reach out directly?"

**Reframe:**
"Got it. Would you be open to a quick email intro? I find those convert way better than cold outreach."

---

## Trust Objections

### "I've never heard of you"

**Acknowledge:**
"Fair point - we're still building awareness."

**Clarify:**
"What would help you feel more comfortable? Case studies, references, a pilot?"

**Reframe:**
"We're trusted by [notable customers] and have [social proof]. Would it help to talk to a customer in your space?"

---

### "We got burned by a similar vendor"

**Acknowledge:**
"I'm sorry to hear that - that's frustrating."

**Clarify:**
"What happened, if you don't mind sharing? I want to make sure we don't repeat those mistakes."

**Reframe:**
"Thanks for sharing that. Here's how we're different: [specific differentiator]. And we're happy to structure things in a way that gives you more control. Would a pilot or phased approach help?"
