# GTM Sequences

Complete multi-touch outreach cadences that get responses.

## Sequence Principles

1. **Multi-channel** - Email alone gets ignored; layer in LinkedIn and phone
2. **Value-first** - Every touch should provide value, not just "checking in"
3. **Persistence with grace** - Follow up without being annoying
4. **Personalization** - Generic = ignored; specific = responses
5. **Clear CTAs** - One ask per message
