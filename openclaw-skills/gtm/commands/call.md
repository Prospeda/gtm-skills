═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

BEFORE YOU DIAL
───────────────
• Best time to call: [suggestion]
• Mindset: [coaching tip]
• Goal: Book a meeting, not sell the product

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
OPENER (5 seconds)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

"Hi [Name], this is [You] from [Company]. Did I catch you at an
okay time?"

IF "NO, BAD TIME":
→ "Totally understand. When's better - later today or tomorrow
   morning?"
   [Book callback, don't pitch]

IF "WHO IS THIS?" / GUARDED:
→ "Fair question. I work with VPs of Sales dealing with
   [relevant challenge]. Was hoping to ask you one quick
   question about that."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
HOOK (10 seconds)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

"I'll be super brief. I noticed [SIGNAL - e.g., you're hiring
5 SDRs right now].

Question: is [RELEVANT CHALLENGE - e.g., SDR ramp time]
something you're actively solving for?"

IF "YES":
→ Go to Discovery

IF "NOT REALLY" / "WE'RE FINE":
→ "Got it. What IS the biggest challenge with [area] right now?"
   [Pivot to their actual pain]

IF "WE USE [COMPETITOR]":
→ "Makes sense. How's that going? What would you change?"
   [Seek the gap]

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
DISCOVERY (30-60 seconds)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Ask 2-3 of these (not all):

SITUATION:
• "What's your current ramp time for new SDRs?"
• "How many reps are you planning to hire this year?"
• "What does your onboarding process look like today?"

PROBLEM:
• "What's the biggest bottleneck in getting reps productive?"
• "When reps miss quota in month 3-4, what's usually the cause?"
• "What have you tried so far?"

IMPACT:
• "If ramp stayed at [current], what does that cost you?"
• "How does that affect your ability to hit [goal]?"

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VALUE (15 seconds)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

"Here's why I called. We helped [SIMILAR COMPANY] cut their
ramp time from [X] to [Y].

The main thing that worked was [ONE SPECIFIC TACTIC].

Would it be worth 15 minutes to see if that could work for you?"

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
CLOSE (10 seconds)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

IF "SURE, SEND ME INFO":
→ "Happy to. But honestly, the info without context won't help
   much. What if we do 15 min this week - if it's not relevant,
   I'll send the summary and you can share with your team.
   How's [specific time]?"

IF "I NEED TO CHECK WITH [BOSS/TEAM]":
→ "Makes sense. Would it help if I joined that conversation?
   That way I can answer questions directly. Want to loop them
   in on a quick call?"

IF "NOT NOW, MAYBE LATER":
→ "Totally fair. When does [initiative] kick off? I'll call back
   then. Mind if I send one thing in the meantime that other
   VPs found useful?"

IF "YES":
→ "Great. I'm looking at [Day] at [Time] or [Day] at [Time].
   Which works better?"
   [Confirm email, send invite immediately]

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
OBJECTION HANDLING
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

"TOO BUSY":
→ "Completely understand. Is there a better week, or is this
   just not a priority right now?"

"NOT INTERESTED":
→ "Fair. Before I let you go - is it the timing, or you just
   don't see the need?"

"WE'RE SET":
→ "Got it. Out of curiosity, what's working well? I hear a lot
   about what doesn't work - always good to hear the wins."

"SEND ME INFO":
→ [See close section above]

"Hey [Name], [You] here. Quick one - saw you're [SIGNAL].

Wanted to share what [SIMILAR COMPANY] did about [CHALLENGE].

Shoot me a note if you want the details. [Your number]. Thanks."

[Under 20 seconds. Don't leave your company name - creates
curiosity]
