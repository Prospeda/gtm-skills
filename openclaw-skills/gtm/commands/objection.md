───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
RESPONSE OPTIONS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

OPTION 1: Direct
"Totally fair. Most of our customers came from [Competitor].
The main reason they switched was [key differentiator].
Is that something you've run into?"

OPTION 2: Curious
"Got it. How long have you been using them?
What's working well, and what would you change if you could?"

OPTION 3: Reframe
"Not suggesting you switch. But when your contract comes up,
wouldn't it help to know what else is out there?
15 min to give you ammunition for negotiation either way."

Subject: re: [Competitor]

Makes sense - they're solid.

Quick thought: 60% of our customers came from [Competitor].

The #1 reason? [Specific gap in competitor].

Not asking you to switch. But when renewal comes up, might help
to know what others are paying and getting.

15 min?

Add to nurture sequence. Reach out:
• 30 days before likely contract renewal
• When competitor has negative news/outage
• When they post about relevant pain point
```

## Objection Handling Principles

1. **Never argue** - You can't win an argument with a prospect
2. **Get curious** - The stated objection is rarely the real one
3. **Agree first** - "You're right, timing is tough..."
4. **Add value** - Give them something even if they say no
5. **Know when to walk** - Some objections are real. Respect them.
